## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum.
Python was first released in 1991.

## Advantages of Python
- Platform Independent
    Python can run on any platform, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and many more.

- Readability
    Python code is easily readable by humans

- Object oriented language
    We can create objects [like variables, functions, etc.] to organize our code and make it more efficient and reusable.

- Less learning time
    It does not take much time to learn Python, as the syntax is very easy to learn, as you will see for yourself :)

- Higher productivity
    You can write more code in less time, as Python is a high-level language.

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) Programming
    Python supports GUI programming, which means you can create GUI applications using Python.

- Ample availability of libraries
    There are hundreds, if not thousands, of libraries available online that can be used to improve your code.
    Libraries are Python programs that can be reused in your code by "importing" them. You will learn about these later.

- Syntax highlighting
    Many IDEs highlight the syntax while you code in Python. This makes it easier to identify the different keywords, identifiers, operators, and so on.

- Free / Open Source programming language
    Python is free to use, which makes it a free programming language.
    Python is open source because you can view and modify the source code of the Python interpreter.

- High-level language
    Python is a high-level language, which means it is easier to write and understand than low-level languages like C and C++, where you have to manage memory and other resources yourself.
