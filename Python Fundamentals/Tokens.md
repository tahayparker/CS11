#&nbspTokens

##&nbspDefinition
Tokens&nbspare&nbspthe&nbspsmallest&nbspindividual&nbspunit&nbspof&nbspa&nbsplanguage.&nbsp&nbsp<br>
They&nbspare&nbspthe&nbspbuilding&nbspblocks&nbspof&nbspa&nbsplanguage.&nbsp&nbsp<br>
It&nbspis&nbspalso&nbspcalled&nbspthe&nbsplexical&nbspunit.


##&nbspTypes&nbspof&nbspTokens
There&nbspare&nbsp5&nbsptypes&nbspof&nbsptokens&nbspin&nbspPython:
-&nbspKeywords
-&nbspIdentifiers
-&nbspLiterals
-&nbspPunctuators&nbsp/&nbspDelimiters
-&nbspOperators

You&nbspmay&nbspremember&nbspthese&nbspas&nbsp"KILPO"

###&nbspKeywords
-&nbspKeywords&nbspare&nbspreserved&nbspwords&nbspin&nbspPython.&nbsp&nbsp<br>
-&nbspThey&nbspcannot&nbspbe&nbsprenamed.&nbsp&nbsp<br>
-&nbspThey&nbsphave&nbspa&nbspspecific&nbspmeaning&nbspand&nbspcannot&nbspbe&nbspused&nbspas&nbspidentifiers.&nbsp&nbsp<br>
-&nbspAll&nbspkeywords&nbspare&nbspin&nbsplowercase,&nbspexcept&nbspfor&nbsp`True`,&nbsp`False`,&nbspand&nbsp`None`,&nbspwhich&nbspstart&nbspwith&nbspa&nbspcapital&nbspletter.&nbsp&nbsp<br>

###&nbspIdentifiers
-&nbspAn&nbspidentifier&nbspis&nbspa&nbsp***fundamental***&nbspunit&nbspin&nbspa&nbspprogramming&nbsplanguage.&nbsp&nbsp<br>
-&nbspExamples&nbspof&nbspidentifiers&nbspare&nbspvariable&nbspnames,&nbspfunction&nbspnames,&nbspclass&nbspnames,&nbspetc.&nbsp&nbsp<br>

Rules&nbspfor&nbspidentifiers:
-&nbspAn&nbspidentifier&nbspcan&nbspbe&nbspa&nbspcombination&nbspof&nbspletters&nbspin&nbsplowercase&nbsp(a&nbspto&nbspz)&nbspor&nbspuppercase&nbsp(A&nbspto&nbspZ)&nbspor&nbspdigits&nbsp(0&nbspto&nbsp9)&nbspor&nbspan&nbspunderscore&nbsp(_).&nbsp&nbsp<br>
-&nbspIdentifiers&nbspare&nbspcase-sensitive,&nbspi.e.&nbspnum1&nbspand&nbspNUM1&nbspare&nbspdifferent&nbspidentifiers.&nbsp&nbsp<br>
-&nbspAn&nbspidentifier&nbspcannot&nbspstart&nbspwith&nbspa&nbspdigit.&nbsp&nbsp<br>
-&nbspAn&nbspidentifier&nbspcan&nbspstart&nbspwith&nbspan&nbspunderscore.&nbsp&nbsp<br>
-&nbspIdentifiers&nbspcannot&nbspbe&nbspthe&nbspkeywords&nbspused&nbspin&nbspPython.&nbsp&nbsp<br>

Examples&nbspof&nbsp**Valid**&nbspIdentifiers:
-&nbsp`myvar`
-&nbsp`my_var`
-&nbsp`myVar`
-&nbsp`_myvar`
-&nbsp`myvar1`
-&nbsp`myvar_1`

-&nbsp`myvar@`&nbsp(special&nbspcharacter)


###&nbspLiterals
-&nbspA&nbspliteral&nbspis&nbspa&nbspconstant&nbspvalue,&nbspi.e.&nbspthese&nbspare&nbspfixed&nbspvalues.&nbsp&nbsp<br>
-&nbspThe&nbspdifferent&nbsptypes&nbspof&nbspliterals&nbspare:

Examples:
-&nbsp`'Hello&nbspWorld'`
-&nbsp`"Hello&nbspWorld"`
-&nbsp`'123'`&nbsp(Even&nbspthough&nbspit&nbspseems&nbspthat&nbspit&nbspis&nbspa&nbspnumber,&nbspit&nbspis&nbspnot&nbspbecause&nbspit&nbspis&nbspenclosed&nbspin&nbspsingle&nbspquotation&nbspmarks)
-&nbsp`"test@test.com"`
