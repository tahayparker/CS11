## Types of Tokens

- Keywords
- Identifiers
- Literals
- Punctuators / Delimiters

### Keywords
- Keywords are reserved words in Python.  <br>
- They cannot be renamed.  <br>
- They have a specific meaning and cannot be used as identifiers.  <br>
- All keywords are in lowercase, except for `True`, `False`, and `None`, which start with a capital letter.  <br>

List of keywords in Python:
