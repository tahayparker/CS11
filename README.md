## Welcome to CS11!

This GitHub repo was made to share all the knowledge that I have gained from studying CS with one of the best teachers in the school, Ms. Shenooja Pareed, for 2 years.

The notes in this repo contain what Shenooja Ma'am taught the batch of 2022-23, and have been improved upon for better understanding.
